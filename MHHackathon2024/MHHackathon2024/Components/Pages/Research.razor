    <div class="mb-6">
        <h3 class="mb-2 text-2xl font-medium">Step 1: Identify a Research Topic</h3>
        <p class="text-base leading-relaxed">Spend some time brainstorming topics that genuinely interest you. Consider subjects you've studied in class, current events, or personal hobbies. Once you've settled on a general area of interest, narrow it down into a specific research question. This question should be specific enough to guide your research but broad enough to allow for exploration and analysis.</p>

    <div class="mb-6">
        <h3 class="mb-2 text-2xl font-medium">Step 2: Experimentation</h3>
        <p class="text-base leading-relaxed">Determine the variables involved in your experiment: independent variable (what you manipulate), dependent variable (what you measure), and any controlled variables (factors you keep constant). Design a procedure or protocol for conducting your experiment, outlining the steps you'll take to test your hypothesis. Consider ethical considerations and safety precautions if your experiment involves human subjects, animals, or hazardous materials.</p>

    <div class="mb-6">
        <h3 class="mb-2 text-2xl font-medium">Step 3: Collect Data</h3>
        <p class="text-base leading-relaxed">Conduct your experiment according to the protocol you've designed, making careful observations and measurements. Record your data systematically, ensuring accuracy and consistency in your measurements. Use appropriate tools and instruments to collect data, and be prepared to repeat experiments if necessary to ensure reliability.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="mb-6">
        <h3 class="mb-2 text-2xl font-medium">Step 4: Data Analysis</h3>
        <p class="text-base leading-relaxed">Organize your data into tables, graphs, or charts to identify patterns, trends, or relationships. Apply statistical analysis techniques, if applicable, to interpret your data and determine if there are significant differences or correlations. Consider any sources of error or variability in your data and discuss their potential impact on your results.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="mb-6">
        <h3 class="mb-2 text-2xl font-medium">Step 5: Present the Research</h3>
        <p class="text-base leading-relaxed">Evaluate your results in relation to your hypothesis, considering whether they support or refute your initial prediction. Discuss the implications of your findings and their significance in the context of existing research or theories. Communicate your results through a research paper, presentation, or poster, following the conventions of scientific communication. Reflect on the strengths and limitations of your study and propose directions for future research to build upon your findings.</p>

        <h3 class="mb-2 text-2xl font-medium">Step 1: Identify a Research Topic and Hypothesis</h3>
        <p class="text-base leading-relaxed">Choose a research topic that interests you and has the potential for experimentation and data collection. Formulate a clear hypothesis or research question that you want to investigate through your experiment. Your hypothesis should be testable and based on existing knowledge or observations.</p>
